SwiftySecurity
==============

Just a bit of syntactic sugar for Security.framework structures. Let me know
if something can be done in a better way.

Note: This requires Cocoa stuff, it is not a pure Swift framework.

###Targets

Update for Swift 0.2.2 (aka Xcode 7.3).

The project includes a single target:
- SwiftySecurity

Note: The Swift mapping of the Security framework changed quite a lot between
versions.

###Why?!

Playing with certificates and such, wanted a more convenient API. Also, I always
liked wrapping stuff ;-)
