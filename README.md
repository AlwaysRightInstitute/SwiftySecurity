SwiftySecurity
==============

Just a bit of syntactic sugar for Security.framework structures. Let me know
if something can be done in a better way.

Note: This requires Cocoa stuff, it is not a pure Swift framework.

###Targets

Uses Swift v2b1 (aka Xcode 7).

The project includes a single target:
- SwiftySecurity

###Why?!

Playing with certificates and such, wanted a more convenient API. Also, I always
liked wrapping stuff ;-)
